############# Data transformation and visualization ############################
# for visualization or clustering â€“ it might be useful to work with transformed versions of the count data.
#The most useful is the log transformation as you have zeros and non-zeros in others - big diff

#VST and rlog transformations remove the dependence of the variance on the mean, 
#particularly the high variance of the logarithm of #count data when the mean 
#is low. Both VST and rlog use the experiment-wide trend of variance over mean, 
#in order to transform the data to remove the experiment-wide trend

#VST - variance stabilizing transformations (VST)
#rlog - incorporates a prior on the sample differences and 
#requires fitting a shrinkage term for each sample and each gene which takes time

#Guidelines:

#    VST is suitable for differential expression analysis: 
#VST can be a good choice if you are interested in identifying 
#differentially expressed genes, as it stabilizes the variance of the counts, 
#which can improve the accuracy of differential expression analysis.

#rlog is suitable for exploratory data analysis: rlog can be a good choice if 
#you are interested in exploratory data analysis, such as clustering 
#or visualization, as it can reduce the effects of outliers and make the 
#data more normally distributed.

#Consider the sample size: VST tends to work better for larger sample sizes, 
#while rlog can be more effective for smaller sample sizes.

#Consider the biological variability: VST assumes that the biological 
#variability is independent of the mean expression level, while rlog does
#not make this assumption. If you have reason to believe that the biological variability is dependent on the mean expression level, rlog may be a better choice.

#Consider the downstream analysis, such as gene set 
#enrichment analysis, may have different requirements for input data. 
#It is important to check the requirements of your downstream analysis 
#to ensure that your choice of transformation is appropriate.

#So, we choose rlog
