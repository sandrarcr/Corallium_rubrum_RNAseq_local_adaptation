Repository for the paper "Does local adaptation influence thermal responses in red coral populations across depth gradients? Transcriptomic insights for effective conservation.". 

This study involves the precious coral _Corallium rubrum_, with analysis of its differential gene expression between two populations from contrasting environments (shallow vs mesophotic), exposed to a control and a temperature stress treatment in a common garden experiment. RNAseq samples were taken every 5 days from each individual.

This experiment includes the following design:

Shallow Population (15-18m): CAS (N=3)x 3T (days 5, 10 and 15) = 9 replicates

Deep Population (48m): LOP (N=3)x 3T (days 5, 10 and 15) = 9 replicates
