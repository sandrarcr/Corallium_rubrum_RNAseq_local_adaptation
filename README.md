Repository for _Corallium rubrum_ differential gene expression analysis for two populations from contrasting environments exposed to temperature stress treatment at 25°C in laboratory conditions. RNA samples were taken every 5 days from each individual. All replicates had a control at 18°C.

This experiment includes the following design:

Shallow Population (15-18m): CAS (N=3)x 3T (days 5, 10 and 15) = 9 replicates

Deep Population (48m): LOP (N=3)x 3T (days 5, 10 and 15) = 9 replicates
