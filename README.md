Repository for Corallium rubrum differential gene expression analysis under a temperature stress treatment at 25°C in laboratory conditions. RNA samples were taken every 5 days from each individual.
This experiment includes the following design:

Population 1: CAS (N=3)x 3T (days 5, 10 and 15) = 9 replicates

Population 2: LOP (N=3)x 3T (days 5, 10 and 15) = 9 replicates
